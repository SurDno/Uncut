A project dedicated to restoration of various elements cut during the development of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky.

# CHANGES
Note: Changes with asterisk next to them are pure cut content restoration. Changes in square brackets are the ones we had to make, with either plus, minus or tilde describing whether a certain feature is added, removed or changed.

## Gameplay Changes
* Restored an ability to heal injured teammates using bandages instead of medkits.

## Quest Changes
* NEW - Find the migration map — descend into the Agroprom Undeground to find the lost migration map. The quest is given by Inquisitor on Duty base.
** [+] Added a previously missing reward - a pack of AP 5,45 ammo and 1500 RU. It was originally a flash drive with data on modifying the gas exhaust of a machine gun as well as GP-25 Koster, but that was later transferred to Hermit's quest and this one was left rewardless.
** [~] Changed dialogue from early draft written by programmers to the one that is way richer in details. This is a recreation of the way the text would have been if game designers were ever rewriting it for final game.
* Restored a requirement to capture the other Cordon level changer and Agroprom level changer in the last phase of Clear Sky Faction War. - SurDno

## Character Changes
* Made Professor Beanpolev move between unused points in his shack instead of staying in the same place.

## Sound Changes
* Restored Father Valerian's greeting and farewell phrases. Besides, since one of the latter was a copy of another, an original file has been ported from Build 3436.
* Restored two unused Sidorovich farewell phrases.

## Dialogue Changes
* Restored a set of unique Scar answers to Suslov and Cold phrases.
* Restored a unique Scar answer to the long starting dialogue with Suslov after returning to CS base after second emission happens.
* Restored a dialogue with Flea Market night trader where you got to convince him you're trustworthy before trading.
* Made Duty Scar neutral towards bandits and Bandit Scar neutral towards Duty in order to restore two dialogues about switching factions. Duty — Bandit relationship has been left unchanged.
* Spawned two loner squads at otherwise unused smart terrains - Shore barricades and Bonfire on shore - in order to restore unique loner Great Swamps dialogues. Since these smart terrains do not have links to any other sublocations, this does not affect faction war in any way.

## Graphics & Visuals Changes
* Restored Clear Sky stalker models from Build 3120.
** [+] Made own icons to fix incosistency between NPC visuals as icons were first developed only after the model change.

# BUGFIXES
* Fixed the game crashing when a squad occupies shore barricades smart terrain due to animation name typo.

# FAQ
Q: Is that like a prerelease build?
A: No. This is more of a mash up of content cut during very different points of development.

Q: Is it a definite version of the game?
A: No. Most things cut were cut for a reason, with time constraints being a very rare scenarioThis is the way the text would have been if game designers were ever rewriting it for final game. Release game is the definite experience.

Q: Is it faithful to developers' intentions? 
A: No. GSC deemed most content removed from the game as unsuitable. Besides, some things cannot be restored properly because they had not been fully done by the point when they got removed.

Q: Is that suitable for a first playthrough?
A: God no. Just play vanilla.

Q: So what's the point of the mod?
A: Providing an interactive tour into the world of Clear Sky cut and unused content. 

# INSTALLATION
1. Ensure there is no 'gamedata' folder in your game directory - Clear Sky Uncut is incompatible with other mods unless you know how to merge them manually.
2. Put 'gamedata' folder from the archive in your game directory.
3. Navigate to the folder with sounds of your language and transfer the 'gamedata' folder from there to your root directory as well.

# SPECIAL THANKS
* **Decane** — huge help with getting xr_smartcover scheme to support def_state_moving parameter.
* **Nemrtvi** — a lot of work done going through the text files finding unused strings.
* **OGSM Team** — for porting B3120 models into the final game format.
