# Clear Sky Uncut
A project dedicated to restoration of various elements cut during the development of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky.

CHANGES

Gameplay:
* Restored an ability to heal injured teammates using bandages instead of medkits.
* Restored a requirement to capture the other Cordon level changer and Agroprom level changer in the last phase of Clear Sky Faction War.

Sounds:
* Restored Father Valerian's greeting and farewell phrases. Besides, since one of the latter was a copy of another, an original file has been ported from Build 3436.

INSTALLATION
1. Ensure there is no 'gamedata' folder in your game directory - Clear Sky Uncut is incompatible with other mods unless you know how to merge them manually.
2. Put 'gamedata' folder from the archive in your game directory.
3. Navigate to the folder with sounds of your language and transfer the 'gamedata' folder from there to your root directory as well.
