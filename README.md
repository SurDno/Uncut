# Clear Sky Uncut
A project dedicated to restoration of various elements cut during the development of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky.

**CHANGES**
Note: Changes with asterisk next to them are pure cut content restoration. Changes in square brackets are the ones I had to make myself, with either plus or minus describing whether a certain feature is added or removed.

Gameplay:
* Restored an ability to heal injured teammates using bandages instead of medkits.
* Restored a requirement to capture the other Cordon level changer and Agroprom level changer in the last phase of Clear Sky Faction War.

Sounds:
* Restored Father Valerian's greeting and farewell phrases. Besides, since one of the latter was a copy of another, an original file has been ported from Build 3436.

Graphics and visuals:
* Restored Clear Sky stalker models from Build 3120.
[+] Made own icons to fix incosistency between NPC visuals and icons due to the lack of those in Build 3120 and lack of any further builds where these icons might be present.

**INSTALLATION**
1. Ensure there is no 'gamedata' folder in your game directory - Clear Sky Uncut is incompatible with other mods unless you know how to merge them manually.
2. Put 'gamedata' folder from the archive in your game directory.
3. Navigate to the folder with sounds of your language and transfer the 'gamedata' folder from there to your root directory as well.

**SPECIAL THANKS**
OGSM Team â€” for porting B3120 models into the final game format.
